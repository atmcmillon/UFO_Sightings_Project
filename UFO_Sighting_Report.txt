Abstract: This project is a look into UFO sightings from across the United States, Great Britain,
Canada, and many other countries. The data is hastily cobbled from a data collection from Kaggle.com,
and it's original source is NUFORC, or the National Unidentified Flying Object Reporting Center.

I intend to use this data project as practice for data science and data analysis, and ask questions
such as:

1. How common are UFO sightings to certain areas? 
a. Namely in the US, to certain states, and with regards to the shape of the UFO?
b. In other countries, are the UFO shapes possibly culturally linked?

2. How common are UFO sightings among certain dates?
a. In the US, are these sightings correlated with dates of hysteria over other political fears?
b. Outside of the US, are these sightings also hysteria or culturally related?

3. Have UFO sightings increased over the years? Are they stable or decreasing with the advent
and advance of modern human visual recording equipment?

Research:
1. UFO sightings typically occur in the US, making up over 85% of the reports and counting; given
that this dataset is incomplete. Fortunately cities from other countries where the country column
is empty are marked with the country in the city tab. US states are listed specifically a majority
of the time. Canada follows in 2nd, with closer to 5% of sightings reported. Obviously this is
biased towards reports from the US, when NUFORC is a US-based organization. This data was gathered
using the SweetViz data visualisation tool/module for the python language.

1.a. Also using SweetViz on the states column, the top 5 US states for sightings are California
(~12%), Washington, Florida, Texas, and New York; each of the latter 4 having ~5% of the reports.
