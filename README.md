# UFO Sighting Data Analysis Project

## Greetings, Brave Earthlings!

Welcome to the UFO Sighting Exploratory Data Analysis Project. Instead of us mere humans going to space, are the extraterrestrials coming to us for a hair-raising Hacktoberfest? It never hurts to evaluate! In this playground data analysis repository, we will evaluate data from UFO sightings worldwide; via the National UFO Reporting Center(NUFORC) `complete.csv` and `scrubbed.csv` datasets at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings). These sets are available for free with a free Kaggle account. I figured this could be this year's
Hacktoberfest-themed repo for beginner/intermediate DA's and programmers(like me!).

I will update any progress I make personally to `UFO_Sighting_Report.txt`, and possibly update the two datasets whenever I find a typo or missing data. Feel free to comb those and make any useful edits, eg. missing country abbreviations in the `'country'` column. Additionally, I may add a `participant_reporting_file.txt` for participants that would rather show their findings than read mine.

## Pick Your Poison

Preferably, I use Python for DA. It has a lot of great libraries, is easy to use for beginners and non-programmer types, and great for visualization. Participants are welcome to use any language they like for DA, and are welcome to add files of all sorts if it helps fix issues other languages may have, or provides other insights.

## Contributing

You don't have to have grey skin, metallic clothing, an amusement with stealing cows, or be from another planet to contribute(the latter might give you connectivity issues though). Anyone may contribute to this repository as long as it provides meaningful statistics, issue-spotting/fixing, visualizations, or even better questions that we can ask ourselves. 

Assertive, unbiased opinion is unwelcome here, ie. derogatory comments towards other users, especially related to this repository. This will be a fun and constructive environment, without taking any sides in the debate of existence of extraterrestial lifeforms. It's simply an investigation into the global phenomena of unidentified flying objects.

## Happy Hacking!
